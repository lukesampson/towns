'''Aberfoyle Park''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|b|ɚ|f|ɔɪ|l}} is a southern [[suburb]] of [[Adelaide]] in the [[City of Onkaparinga]], [[South Australia]]. It has a [[shopping mall]] called &quot;The Hub&quot;, several [[primary school]]s and a [[Aberfoyle Park High School|public high school]], one of the biggest in the state.

==History==
[[File:Windebanks rd, hv and abpk.jpg|left|thumb|Windebanks Road]]
In 1845, Christian Sauerbier, from Germany, purchased land south of Adelaide, near [[Happy Valley, South Australia|Happy Valley]]. In 1856, Sauerbier owned eleven sections of land in the area. The area became agricultural and the Sauerbier family was renowned for the quality of their stud stock and the orange grove that was attached to their property. Christian Sauerbier died in 1893 and the property was given to his son, John Chris. During the [[First World War]], when anti-German sentiment was at a high in Australia, Chris changed his last name to Aberfoyle - a reference to an area in [[Perthshire, Scotland]] where his father had lived for a while. John Chris died in 1923 and his estate was subdivided and sold by James Henry Browne. Agriculture was the core of the districts economy for quite some time. Inevitably, the farmlands were turned into suburban expansion and the suburb of Aberfoyle Park was proclaimed on 10 July 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onkaparingacity.com/history/viewsuburb.asp?content=aberfoyle |title=Aberfoyle Park  European History and Heritage |accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aberfoyle Park Post Office opened on 16 November 1981.&lt;ref name = &quot;Post Office&quot;&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List  | publisher = Premier Postal Auctions | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=SA&amp;country= | accessdate = 26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
