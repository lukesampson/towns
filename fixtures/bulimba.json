It is four kilometres (direct distance) south-east of the CBD, and is located on the southern bank of the [[Brisbane River]]. Bulimba means ''magpie lark'', which is the name also given to Bulimba Creek. At the 2011 Australian Census the suburb recorded a population of 5,941.<ref name=\"census11\"/>\n\nThe suburb is occasionally seen in Australian media, as the electorate of the Federal Member for Griffith and former Prime Minister of Australia [[Kevin Rudd]] covers Bulimba. It is also home to several Army Cadet Units \u2013 12 ACU and 161 Aviation Detachment at Bulimba Barracks on Apollo Road.\n\nBulimba is also a popular meeting place, especially on weekends, with a variety of cafes, restaurants, cinemas and a hotel.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Queensland_State_Archives_2884_Bulimba_State_School_Brisbane_1946.png|thumb|left|Bulimba State School, 1946]]\nBulimba is part of the traditional lands of the [[Turrubal people]] who have lived in the area for at least 20,000 years.<ref>2002.

Thompson Computing.</ref>\n\nIn the 1820s Bulimba was zoned as a farming district, however was subdivided as a result of the 1880s land boom. In its early days the suburb was (unusually) located on both sides of the river. The part of Bulimba on the northern bank of the river is today regarded as [[Teneriffe, Queensland|Teneriffe]] or [[New Farm]].<ref> (7 June 2011).
