Bellbowrie lies 17 kilometres west-southwest of Brisbane's city centre.  It is a rapidly developing semi-rural area due to Brisbane's growth heading in a westwards direction. \n\nThe initial subdivisions in the area were commenced in the early 1970s.  Development slowed in the aftermath of the [[1974 Brisbane flood]] which saw much of the eastern, lower-lying areas of the suburb badly inundated with water.  Since the construction of the [[Wivenhoe Dam]] in the 1980s the threat of floods has been reduced and development has increased.  Many acreage owners are subdividing their properties and as a consequence, significant areas of bushland are being cleared.  Several new housing estates began development in 2001 on land that used to be pineapple farms.\n\n[[Moggill Road]], which bisects the suburb, is a main thoroughfare for traffic passing from [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] to central [[Brisbane]]. Commuters may use the [[Brisbane Ferries|Moggill Ferry]] to gain access to Moggill Road as an alternative to the Centenary Highway.  Neighbouring suburbs include: [[Moggill, Queensland|Moggill]], [[Pullenvale, Queensland|Pullenvale]], [[Pinjarra Hills, Queensland|Pinjarra Hills]] and [[Anstead, Queensland|Anstead]]. \n\nBellbowrie has an abundance of recreational facilities including many off-leash areas for dogs to play in.  The suburb also borders the Brisbane River and some residents have boat ramps in order to access it.\n\nBellbowrie is part of the 'Tyakunda Scout District', ''Tyakunda'' being an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning 'land of the rolling hills'[http://tyakunda.scoutsqld.com.au/about.html]. The local Scout group is called \"[http://www.moggill.scoutsqld.com.au Moggill Scout Group]\", and is named so as Moggill was the original name of the area. Bellbowrie is part of the Pullenvale Ward for [[Brisbane City Council]] Elections as well as the seat of Moggill for state elections and the seat of Ryan for federal elections.\n\nThere are two schools in the area: Moggill State Primary School and Pullenvale State Primary School.  \n\nThe streetscape in Bellbowrie benefits from the provision of underground power and there are few power poles to be seen.\n\nTwo community/lobby groups are active in the area, the Moggill Community Association and the Rural Environmental Planning Association Inc.\n\n==Moggill Cemetery==\n\nMoggill Cemetery is located on the eastern side of Moggill Road, Bellbowrie in subdivision 2 of portions 7 & 8, County of Stanley, Parish of Moggill. \n\nIn March 1851, the original land owner, Joseph Lewis, purchased portions 7 & 8. \n\nIt is believed  portions 7 & 8 was used as church [[graveyard]], circa 1855, Only clues remain as to the exact location of the associated, possibly [[Methodist]], [[chapel]]. George Mounser, who accidentally drowned at Moggill on 4 March 1855, is assumed to have been the first person buried in the graveyard. \n\nIn 1865, the land was sanctioned as a [[Cemetery]]. \n\nIn June 1921, the Governor, Sir Matthew Nathan, ordered that the cemetery be permanently reserved and placed under the control of trustees: John Anstead, John Bird, Maurice William Doyle, Norman Charles Robert Sexton and Frederick Charles Sugars (Government Gazette, 25 June 1921, p 2011). \n\nIn February 1922, the land was resumed by the Crown (Certificate of Title, no. 270863). \n\nIn July 1930, the Governor, Sir Thomas Herbert Goodwin, passed control of Moggill Cemetery over to the Brisbane City Council (Government Gazette, 21 July 1930, p.&nbsp;42).<ref>[http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/facilities-recreation/cemeteries/visiting-our-cemeteries/historic-cemeteries/index.htm Brisbane City Council Historic Cemeteries].
